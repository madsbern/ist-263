        Hi my name is Maddie Berniker. Right now I'm undecided but I'm interested in fashion. I've interned with Zen water and Core water as well as Core food. I helped around the photoshoots and worked with the marketing team. I also watched their design process for upcoming events, and their media and website pages. I love watching hockey especially when they fight. Best seat in the house is in the corner front row. The O.C. is such a good tv show I would recommend if you like shows like 90210 or Gossip Girl.
